# Letterboxd-User-Analytics
In this Project I exported Letterboxd user data and then scrapped movie data using Selenium & BeautifulSoup.
Then I cleaned, manipulated and preprocessed the data in Python so that I can later create visualizations.
Then I created visualizations based on user analytics on PowerBI.
